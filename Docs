Comments for HR:

My experience with the HR team was average. While routine processes were managed well, I feel that more empathy and support during employee concerns—especially during challenging times—would significantly enhance the overall employee experience.

Comments for Management:

My experience with the management team was not entirely positive, especially during a period of personal medical emergency. I believe a more compassionate and supportive approach from management during such critical times would go a long way in building trust and improving employee morale.
